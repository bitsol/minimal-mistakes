When you want to build an embedded hardware project, or just purchase a cheap board for its possibilities, you should turn to the Raspberry Pi.
## Why?
At this point, you're probably asking yourself why you should even bother using a Raspberry Pi. Here are some **pros** of using this full Linux system board.
- Power. If you want to stack multiple projects, or run a few services (such as GPIO [General Purpose Input Output] + Bluetooth + a web and SSH [Secure Shell] server) that use some computing power, the Raspberry Pi is your friend.
- Price. The Arduino is expensive, but one might purchase a clone for as cheap as $5. If you plan to use one of those small $5 microcontrollers, chances are you would benefit more from a stripped-down OS running on a $10 Raspberry Pi Zero W. How would you benefit?
  - 40 GPIO pins (header optional)
  - Integrated Wifi and Bluetooth.
  - Linux = flexibility vs 
  
## Which One?
On that note, you really should only be worrying about a couple models.
### [Raspberry Pi Zero](https://www.adafruit.com/product/2885) ([W](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3400))

This tiny thing packs a real punch.

~Good luck finding anyone to sell you one at $5, though.~ [Adafruit](https://www.adafruit.com) sells these at the MSRP: $5. Actually, $10 for the wireless model, which did I mention comes with Bluetooth?

You get 512 MB of RAM, a 1 GHz core, and a flexible form factor that could even fit in a [mint tin](https://blog.adafruit.com/2016/03/04/mintypi-a-pi-zero-based-gaming-system-in-a-mint-tin-piday-raspberrypi-raspberry_pi/).

Problems: It's underpowered (but much more powerful than the average microcontroller), and the ports are all mini-sized, requiring adapters galore to use it in a desktop fashion. But you wouldn't use it as one, would you?

So far we have a simply *more powerful* ~microcontroller~ Linux desktop. Why justify the cost? A powerhouse (one that only costs pennies a year worth of energy) can do much more. Stack much more projects, pay one-third of the cost for an official board, and accomplish more than with an Arduino.

What if you **do** want a "desktop" rival? What if you want to do even more? Read on...

### [Raspberry Pi 3](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3055)
The Raspberry Pi third-gen [flagship board](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-3-model-b/) is my weakness. What can justify paying $35 instead of $10?

A quad-core (it can do all the things), 1.2 GHz Broadcom CPU and 1 GB of RAM. *And*, of course, wireless on board.

#### Bonus: [Compute Module](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3440)
A flexible card containing all that yummy Pi goodness in a slim form factor.
