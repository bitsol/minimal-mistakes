## About This Site
I'm passionate about technology, and have been for my whole life. I hope I can help you feel the same. My blog will contain a mixture of tutorials, personal stories, successes, and failures. If you ever find my content useful, please share it with others.

## Contact Me
You might be able to find me spread out across the internet. Most importantly, [my Github profile name is bitsol](https://github.com/bitsol), and [I can be found on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/solomon-victorino-189057122). And if you really need to, you can also [email me](mailto:solomonvictorino@gmail.com).

### Technical Credits
The source code for the website can be found by clicking the link above, and was forked from the amazing [minimal-mistakes](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes) theme. As of now it is hosted on Github Pages (many thanks) and is built with Jekyll (also awesome).
