When you want to build an embedded hardware project, or just purchase a cheap board for its possibilities, you should turn to the Raspberry Pi.
## Which One?
On that note, you really should only be worrying about three models.

This tiny thing packs a real punch.

~Good luck finding anyone to sell you one at $5, though.~ [Adafruit](https://www.adafruit.com) sells these at the MSRP: $5. Actually, $10 for the built-in wireless model, which did I mention comes with Bluetooth?
